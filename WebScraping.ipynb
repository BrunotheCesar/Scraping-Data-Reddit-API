We, as New Zealand citizens and humans of Earth, have experiences many consequences of globalisation, urbanisation, and neoliberal economic developments. While abundance of goods and services have been made available for our enjoyment, the social and environment costs of such abundance are increasingly becoming serious and immediate. I hope Labour will continue to work with the Green Party to demonstrate to the New Zealand public that we can move forward in a way that is responsible, compassionate, and inclusive to other regardless of ethnicity, gender and class. I hope this government can produce positive results and change people's lives for the better, and, sequentially, people will become more accepting of some left-leaning thoughts. \n",
